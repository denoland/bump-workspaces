# @deno/bump-workspaces

> A tool for upgrading Deno workspace packages using conventional commits

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/denoland/bump-workspaces/graph/badge.svg?token=KUT5Q1PJE6)](https://codecov.io/gh/denoland/bump-workspaces)

This tool detects necessary version upgrades for workspaces packages using
[Conventional Commiets](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and
creates a PR.

# Try it

Run this command with `--dry-run` flag in your Deno workspace-enabled project
and see what this command does:

```sh
deno run -A jsr:@deno/bump-workspaces@0.1.15/cli --dry-run
```

# How it works

The below steps describe what this command does:

- Read `deno.json` at the current directory. Read "workspaces". Read `deno.json`
  of each workspace package.
- Collect the git commit messages between the latest tag and the current branch.
- Calculate the necessary updates for each package. (See the below table for
  what version upgrades are performed for each conventional commit tag.)
- Create and print the release note.
- Stop here if `--dry-run` specified, and continue if not.
- Save necessary updates to each `deno.json`.
- Create a new branch `release-YYYY-MM-DD`
- Make git commit the version changes using `GIT_USER_NAME` and `GIT_USER_EMAIL`
  env vars.
- Create a github pull request using `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` env
  vars.
- That's all.

Note: Don't worry if your commits don't completely follow the conventional
commits. You can still manually update the PR generated by this tool. The PR
body includes the information about what commits are handled by this tool and
what are not.

# CI set up

Set up the GitHub Actions yaml like the below, and trigger the workflow
manually:

```yaml
name: version_bump

on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  build:
    name: version bump
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15

    steps:
      - name: Clone repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Deno
        uses: denoland/setup-deno@v1

      - name: Run workspaces version bump
        run: |
          git fetch --unshallow origin
          deno run -A jsr:@deno/bump-workspaces@0.1.15/cli
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BOT_TOKEN }}
```

## Commit titles

This tool uses the commit titles as the input for detecting which modules and
versions to update. The commit titles need to follow the following format:

```
<tag>(<scopes,...>): <commit message>
```

Some examples are:

```
fix(foo): fix a bug
fix(baz,qux): fix a bug
feat(bar): add a new feature
chore(foo): clean up
chore(bar): clean up
BREAKING(quux): some breaking change
```

This example results in the following version updates:

| module | version |
| ------ | ------- |
| foo    | patch   |
| bar    | minor   |
| baz    | patch   |
| qux    | patch   |
| quux   | major   |

The tool automatically detects following commit tags:

- BREAKING
- feat
- fix
- perf
- docs
- deprecation
- refactor
- test
- style
- chore

If a module has `BREAKING` commits, then `major` version will be updated. If a
module has `feat` commits, `minor` version will be updated. Othrewise `patch`
version will be update.

| tag         | version |
| ----------- | ------- |
| BREAKING    | major   |
| feat        | minor   |
| fix         | patch   |
| perf        | patch   |
| docs        | patch   |
| deprecation | patch   |
| refactor    | patch   |
| test        | patch   |
| style       | patch   |
| chore       | patch   |

## Scope required tags

The following tags require scope specified because they don't make sense without
scopes. If these tags specified without scopes, they are raised as diagnostics
in README.

- BREAKING
- feat
- fix
- perf
- deprecation
